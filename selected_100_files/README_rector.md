## Dataset Statistics

### PHP Version Migration Overview
| Metric | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Total Files | 100 | 100% |

| Files Already Modern | 0 | 0.0% |
| **Total PHP Version Changes** | **521** | - |
| Average Changes per File | 5.2 | - |

### PHP Version Evolution Analysis
This dataset focuses exclusively on transformations that move code from older PHP versions to PHP 8.3, including:

- **PHP 5.4+**: Array syntax modernization (`array()` → `[]`)
- **PHP 7.0+**: Null coalescing (`??`), spaceship operator (`<=>`), scalar type declarations
- **PHP 7.1+**: Nullable types, void return types
- **PHP 7.4+**: Arrow functions, property types, null coalescing assignment
- **PHP 8.0+**: Constructor property promotion, match expressions, named arguments
- **PHP 8.1+**: Enums, readonly properties, new initializers
- **PHP 8.2+**: Readonly classes, DNF types
- **PHP 8.3+**: Typed class constants, readonly amendments

## File Size Distribution

| **Files Requiring Migration** | **100** (100.0%) | - |
| **Files Already Modern** | **0** (0.0%) | - |

### Change Distribution Analysis
- **Change Density**: 9.59 version changes per 1000 LOC
- **Migration Coverage**: 100% focus on PHP version upgrades only

## Research Applications

### LLM vs Professional Tool Comparison - Version Specific Focus
This dataset provides **professional baseline results** specifically for PHP version migrations:

1. **Pure Version Migration Data**: Only version-specific transformations, no code quality noise
2. **Objective Version Metrics**: Exact PHP version upgrade opportunities identified
3. **Migration Complexity**: Natural distribution of version upgrade difficulty
4. **Professional Validation**: Industry-standard tool baseline for version migrations

### Experimental Design Suggestions

#### 1. **Version Migration Accuracy**
- Compare LLM-identified version upgrades vs Rector findings
- Test LLM understanding of PHP version feature evolution
- Evaluate migration path recommendations (5.x → 8.3)

#### 2. **Version-Specific Pattern Recognition**
- Test LLM recognition of version-specific syntax opportunities
- Assess understanding of PHP version compatibility requirements
- Compare version upgrade prioritization between tools

#### 3. **Migration Path Analysis**
- Analyze which PHP version features LLMs identify correctly
- Study progression understanding (7.0 → 7.4 → 8.0 → 8.3)
- Evaluate consistency in version-specific transformations

## Usage Instructions

### For LLM Version Migration Research
1. Use individual files as test cases for LLM version migration
2. Compare LLM results against Rector version baseline in `metadata.json`
3. Analyze version patterns using `summary.csv`
4. Reference specific PHP version rules from individual reports

### For Version Migration Analysis
1. Load `summary.csv` for quantitative version analysis
2. Correlate file characteristics with version migration complexity
3. Analyze distribution of PHP version upgrade opportunities
4. Generate version migration research metrics

## Validation & Reproducibility

### Professional Tool Validation - Version Specific
